* Don't ever. ever. ever! write emoji's in my code. Not even in markdown files.
* If you write any comments in code, keep them very minimal and very short. Also don't write it as if it's a response to me. Consider them comments in production code that other people will understand.
* If I correct you, don't tell me I'm right.
